# pywal-kde
A fork of the original [Pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal). Please support the original creator.

For me, at least, Pywal has never been able to set the wallpaper in KDE Plasma. This became a minor inconvenience, having to set the wallpaper independently from changing the colour scheme, so I fixed it. Enjoy.
Install the same way you'd normally install Pywal.

- ``git clone https://github.com/the404devs/pywal-kde.git``
- ``cd pywal-kde``
- ``pip3 install .``

### *0.0.1 (09/16/19)*
----------------------
- Forked from (https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal)
- Tweaked ''wallpaper.py'' to add wallpaper-changing functionality on Plasma
